		<h2>About Murphy</h2>
		<p>John Murphy is a key character in The 100, a post-apocalyptic TV series. Initially introduced as a rebellious, self-serving troublemaker, Murphy often clashes with others due to his volatile temper and survival-driven decisions. He begins as a member of the 100 juvenile delinquents sent to Earth from a space station to test if the planet is habitable. Over time, Murphy undergoes significant character development. His cynical nature and instinct for self-preservation remain central, but he also shows loyalty to his friends and a willingness to make personal sacrifices. Despite his flaws, Murphy becomes a complex, resourceful, and ultimately heroic figure in the series.</p>
